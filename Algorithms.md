Algorithms for Problems
=======================

## Problem 1
(Add possible methods to solve the problem. Write the method we use and why it is best)

## Problem 6
(Add possible methods to solve the problem. Write the method we use and why it is best)

## Problem 17
(Add possible methods to solve the problem. Write the method we use and why it is best)

### Notes
We know that:

 - 1 -> "one"
 - 2 -> "two"
 - 3 -> "three"
 - and so forth
 - 20 -> "twenty"
 - 21 -> "twenty one" (String of `20` + String of `1`, separated by a space)

## Problem 551
